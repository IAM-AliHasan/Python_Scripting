Project Overview

The Folder File Lister is a Python program designed to list all files within specified folders provided by the user. This tool simplifies file management by allowing users to easily view and access the contents of any directory during runtime. The program leverages Python's built-in modules and showcases fundamental programming concepts such as loops, lists, and exception handling.
Key Features of program:

    User Input: The program prompts the user to input the folder path(s) during runtime, making it dynamic and flexible for different use cases.

    File Listing: Utilizes Python's built-in modules to traverse the directory structure and list all files within the specified folders.

    For Loop and Lists: Efficiently iterates through the folder contents using for loops and stores file information in lists for easy management and output.

    Exception Handling: Implements robust error handling to manage exceptions, such as invalid folder paths or permission issues, ensuring that the program runs smoothly even in the face of errors.
